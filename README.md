# Programming Problems

This Repository contains the code of my solutions to various programming problems
and challenges.

Working out the solutions for these problems gives me good practice implementing
common data structures & algorithms.  I always simply read the problem
requirements, and then begin trying to come up with a solution on my own.
I try to look up as little as possible, and only do so when I'm stuck or unsure
how to solve the problem.  I also use a notepad as a scratch paper where I can
write a few things out to help visualize the steps in the program as I'm
figuring out the correct solution.


Of course you can't see the process of solving the solution in the code examples
here because they are all the final solutions that work correctly.  But I try to
add comments explaining how I arrived at the solution and any details about the
code that I think might be relevant.
