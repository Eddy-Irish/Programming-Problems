# Programming Problems

This Repository contains the code of my solutions to various programming problems
and challenges.

Working out the solutions for these problems gives me good practice implementing
common data structures & algorithms.  I always simply read the problem
requirements, and then begin trying to come up with a solution on my own,
looking up as little as possible, and only when I'm stuck or unsure how to
solve the problem.

Of course you can't see the process of solving the solution in the code examples
here because they are all the final solutions that work correctly.  But I try to
add comments explaining how I arrived at the solution and any details about the
code that I think might be relevant.
